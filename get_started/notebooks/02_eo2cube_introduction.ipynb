    "## Background\n",
    "eo2cube is underpinned by the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) (ODC), an open source software package that has an ever growing number of users, contributors and implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODC and eo2cube platforms are designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Catalogue large amounts of Earth observation data\n",
    "* Provide a Python based API for high performance querying and data access\n",
    "* Give users easy ability to perform exploratory data analysis\n",
    "* Allow scalable sub-national-scale processing of the stored data\n",
    "* Track the provenance of data to allow for quality control and updates\n",
    "\n",
    "The eo2cube project catalogues data from a range of satellite sensors and has adopted processes and terminology that users should be aware of to enable efficient querying and use of the datasets stored within.\n",
    "This notebook introduces these important concepts and forms the basis of understanding for the remainder of the notebooks in this beginner's guide.\n",
    "Resources to further explore these concepts are recommended at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Earth Observation Data Cube\n",
    "\n",
    "ODC is an Open Source Project for the geospatial data management and analyses of Big Earth data such as satellite time series. The overall goal is to unleash the power of satellite data. The core of the ODC is a set of Python libraries and a PostgreSQL database. The ODC impacts powerfully the increased value of continuously provided satellite time series. Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) is a founding partner of the Open Data Cube (ODC) and is committed to contributing to the ODC architecture as part of the ODC community. According to CEOS, eo2cube seeks to encourage others to join the initiative to meet important goals of societal benefits, similar to the objectives of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) and Google Earth Engine (GEE), but differing inimplementation."

    "\n",
    "Landsat missions are jointly operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n",
    "Sentinel missions are operated by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n",
    "One significant difference between the two programs is the spatial resolution: each Landsat pixel represents 30 x 30 m on the ground while each Sentinel-2 pixel represents 10 x 10 m to 60 x 60 m depending on the spectral band.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectral bands\n",
    "All of the datasets listed above are captured by multispectral satellites. \n",
    "The multispectral satellites primarily measure light reflected from the Earth's surface in discrete sections of the electromagnetic spectrum, known as *spectral bands*.  \n",
    "Figure 1 shows the spectral bands for recent Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors, helping to compare how each sensor samples the overall electromagnetic spectrum directly. Landsat 5 TM is not displayed in this image; for reference, it measured light in seven bands that covered the same regions as bands 1 to 7 on Landsat 7 ETM+.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='color:red'>**cannot see**</span>\n",
    "![Image](https://prd-wret.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/dmidS2LS7Comparison.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Figure 1:** **The bands that are detected by each of the satellites are shown in the numbered boxes and the width of each box represents the spectral range that band detects.**\n",
    "The bands are overlaid on the percentage transmission of each wavelength returned to the atmosphere from the Earth relative to the amount of incoming solar radiation. \n",
    "The y-axis has no bearing on the comparison of the satellite sensors [[source]](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/l/landsat-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 highlights that specific band designations differ between sensors. When working with different sensors, it is crucial to be aware of the differences in their bands from the sensors and any impact on analysis. For example, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ number their red, green, and blue sensors as 3, 2, and 1, so we get a true-color image when we combine them. However, Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI (A and B) number their red, green, and blue sensors as 4, 3, and 2. \n",
    "So, DEA band naming is based on the spectral band name and sample region to avoid confusion. We will cover the naming convention with more details later in the [DEA band naming conventions section](#DEA-band-naming-conventions).  <span style='color:red'>**not found**</span>"

    "\n",
    "eo2cube offers Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for each sensor listed above. \n",
    "The [ARD standard](http://ceos.org/ard/) for satellite data requires several processing steps and the creation of additional attributes for the data. eo2cube's ARD datasets have the following processing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geometric correction:** It includes (1) establishing the ground position. For example, it corrects imagery acquired at different times, seasons, and geographic locations to track meaningful changes over time and (2) removing the effects of image perspective (tilt) and relief (terrain) effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Surface reflectance correction:** It includes adjustments (1) for sensor/instrument gains, biases and offsets, and (2) for terrain illumination and sensor viewing angle to the pixel position on the surface.\n",
    "Once satellite data is processed to surface reflectance, pixel values from the same sensor can be compared consistently spatially and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Observation attributes:** Per-pixel metadata such as quality flags (pixel_qa, Landsat) or the sen2cor scene classification (scl, Sentinel 2) and content attribution enable users to make informed decisions about the suitability of the products for their use. For example, clouds, cloud shadows, missing data, saturation, and water are common pixel level attributes.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Surface reflectance\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical sensors (ex.  Landsat and Sentinel-2) measure the light energy reflected from the Earth's surface, and the source of the measured light energy is the sun. The sensors collect light energy within specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. A band represents each region in the spectrum. The sensor measures the intensity of light (known as \"radiance\") in each spectral band. Many factors affect radiation: the sun's position, the sensor view angle to the ground, and Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, it is better to determine how much light was reflected initially at the ground level. Surface reflectance can be calculated using robust physical models to correct the observed radiance values based on atmospheric conditions, sun angle, sensor geometry, and local topography or terrain. It is known as bottom-of-atmosphere surface reflectance or Level 2A data.\n",

    "### SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data\n",
    "\n",
    "Radar satellites (ex. Sentinel-1) are active systems. A SAR instrument records the amount of that energy reflected from the Earth's surface by sending out microwave radiation, differing from passive systems, which rely on the illumination of the Earth by the sun. "
